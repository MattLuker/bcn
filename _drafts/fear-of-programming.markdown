# The Fear

Trying to do, or learn, something New brings about an element of fear that requires some thought aND focus.  Knowing that the fear will come should help to prepare you for it.

Persistence is the best way to overcome the fear. I'm talking about some True Grit here people. There will be times where you feel like a fraud. Realize that this is totally normal and everyone feels this way at some point or other.  Don't Give in to this feeling, like the man said "When going through hell, keep going".

# The Frustration 

Close behind the fear comes The frustraition.  This happens when you Get stuck and everything you try doesn't work.  


At times like this there are several tactics you can do to get past the frustration.

* Take a step back.
* Work on something else.
* Ask for help.
* Review documentation.

## Take a Step Back

This is usually effective because sometimes you get too close to a problem and you can't see the solution cause its wider than you can see.  or you need another approach to the problem.

sometimes the best thing to do is to sleep on it.  this works especially well if you've put in a full day, the. you get jammed up at the end.  I hate ending the day stuck on a problem, but sometimes there's no way around it.  in these cases it feels really good to fix the problem first thing in the morning.  a surprising amount of my problems are solved this way.

## Work on Something Else

If it's still early in the day and you're jammed up, take a minute and work on some thing else.  There are always a bunch if little problems to solve, or features to impliment.
