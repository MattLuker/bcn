# The Fear

Trying to do, or learn, something New brings about an element of fear that requires some thought aND focus.  Knowing that the fear will come should help to prepare you for it.

Persistence is the best way to overcome the fear. I'm talking about some True Grit here people. There will be times where you feel like a fraud. Realize that this is totally normal and everyone feels this way at some point or other.  Don't Give in to this feeling, like the man said "When going through hell, keep going".

# The Frustration 

Close behind the fear comes The frustraition.  This happens when you Get stuck and everything you try doesn't work.  


At times like this there are several tactics you can do to get past the frustration.

* Take a step back.
* Work on something else.
* Ask for help.
* Review documentation.

## Take a Step Back

This is usually effective because sometimes you get too close to a problem and you can't see the solution cause its wider than you can see.  or you need another approach to the problem.

sometimes the best thing to do is to sleep on it.  this works especially well if you've put in a full day, the. you get jammed up at the end.  I hate ending the day stuck on a problem, but sometimes there's no way around it.  in these cases it feels really good to fix the problem first thing in the morning.  a surprising amount of my problems are solved this way.

## Work on Something Else

If it's still early in the day and you're jammed up, take a minute and work on some thing else.  There are always a bunch if little problems to solve, or features to impliment.

Another task that usually doesn't get enough love is writing documentation for your project.  when stuck it might be the perfect time to go back and document those features that do work.  

After a short pause and the feeling of accomplishment from completing some other task, the solution to original problem might be right there in front of you.

## Ask for Help

If you're really in a jam maybe the only solution is to get another set of eyes on the problem. Some great places for help are mailing lists, Stack overflow and other forums, and a code mentor if you have one.

Having someone live to talk to might also make the connection needed to blast through the problem.

## Review the Documentation

We're all guity of skimming the docs to find the quickest way to learn what we need, but when that's not enough take a few minutes and really grok the documentation.

For example, it's hard to fully understand how a complex topic like recursive functions work the first time through (or maybe the third or fifth time).

# Make Mistakes

Your program isn't going to work the first time you run it, almost guarantee it, so get used to the code > run > debug iteration.

It can take quite a few times through the loop to get something working the way you need.


# Keep the End in Mind

Remember why you're working on the project. Think of how much better your life will be when you've solved the problem in a way that can be repeated the next time.
