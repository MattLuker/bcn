# DVD Pila! On Rails

It has been quite a few months since I’ve done any work on [DVD Pila!](https://github.com/asommer70/dvdpila), and there has been an increasing number of little frustrations with the way things worked.

I think the biggest frustration was after creating 600+ DVDs in the site loading the index page always generated a pause.  I totally don’t blame that on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) cause I know there are multiple ways I could have made things work better.

Paging is the first thing that comes to mind.  Also, learning more about Ember and cleaning up some of the code that I uses would probably definitely help some.

So long story short, I finally got motivate enough to rebuild the web app using Ruby on Rails.

Changing from Ember to Rails is a pretty big switch.  It’s going from full blast front-end JavaScript site to backend Ruby site.  So not only did I use Rails for generating the HTML, but I also replaced the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) backend with Rails.  Which maybe using some Flask templates to generate more of the HTML would have been better too.

Either way developing, or re-developing, the site with Rails was a lot of fun and only took about eighteen hours vs about a month the first time around.

## Conclusion

There’s no question that using Rails to rebuild the site helped things go a lot faster, but you can’t give Rails all the credit for the shorter development time.  I looked back at the first commits to the project and when the first release was created on Github.  The time from initial import to release was about a month.

The thing that took most of the time back then was learning Ember.js form the ground up and trying to massage my limited JavaScript knowledge into how I wanted things to work.  Even back then I probably knew more Ruby than I did actual JavaScript, but it was a great project to learn Ember and I had a lot of fun working on it.

It was also a lot of fun rebuilding it in Rails.  In my very humble opinion of all the frameworks, libraries, etc that I’ve used Rails seems to be the best at getting you to a working “something” in the shortest amount of time.

There are a few minor features and bug fixes I’d like to work on so I’ll probably work on it for thirty minutes to an hour here and there over the next few weeks, but for the most part DVD Pila! Is back up and going strong for the foreseeable future.  Also, going to work on updating the documentation in the wiki and maybe add some more blog posts.

Been an awesome ride so far, and who knows down the road I’ll probably use DVD Pila! As a test bed for learning whatever web technology is grabbing my attention at the moment.

Party On!
