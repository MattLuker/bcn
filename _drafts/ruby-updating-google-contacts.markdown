# Updating Google Contacts

Getting a friends list from Facebook is useful all by itself to see how many friends you have, their names, etc.  What would be more useful would be to update, or add, them in Google Contacts.

Who knows when having a link to their Facebook picture in Google may be useful.

I once knew a guy who saved the profile pic of all his Facebook friends... wait no, no I didn't know that guy.  But you could be that guy!


## Enabling the Contact API

Like we did with the Google Sheets API, the Contacts API needs to be enabled in the [Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com).

* Log into the *Console*.
* *Select* your project.
* Click on *APIs & auth* > then click *APIs*
* Click the *Contacts API* link under the "Google Apps APIs" column.
* Click the *Enable API* button.

Now we should be good to go.
