# BCN Dev Blog Change of Focus

## Switching Back

Because the [BCN Rails project](https://github.com/asommer70/bcn) has sort of reached a 1.0 version (there’s still some bugs to work out), I’m going to change the focus of this blog.  The past posts since after the first few have been tutorial posts for Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

The thought being that tutorial posts would be more valuable then me droning on and on about the state of the project.  My assumption was that people would rather read how to do something than a history of what was done.

Well now that I’ve completed all the Ruby posts I can think of outside of Rails, and all the Rails posts that I can think of surrounding BCN, and the projects I’ve worked on, the focus of the blog will switch back to detailing milestones in the project.

## New Projects

My newest project that I’ll be blogging about is the [Audio Pila! Rails](https://github.com/asommer70/audiopila-rails) project.  Initially my idea for Audio Pila! was to develop it in Node to run a client on a Raspberry Pi connecting to it via Bluetooth.

Well that is a pretty complicated undertaking I found out.  Because I’m impatient and wanted to get document building an app from the ground up I decided to whip up a Rails version to run on a server.  Very much like the DVD Pila! project you could say.

## Conclusion

I think that’s all for now, I’ll try to update this blog as I do more development on BCN and hopefully intersperse some tutorial posts as well.  

Party On!
