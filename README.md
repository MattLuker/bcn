# BCN Rails Project

## Origin Story

The Boone Community Network needed to update their website and wanted some advanced features with mapping and sharing content.

After spending an afternoon looking into similar projects we decided to build our own.  Doesn't everyone do that?


## Demo Site

The [BCN Demo](http://bcn.thehoick.com) site code is updated from the repository nightly and the database is dumped during the process.

Feel free to play around and try things out.
