# Intro to BCN


I’ve become involved with a new project (through a Craigslist ad). The prjoect is updating [Boone Community Network](http://boonecommunitynetwork.com/) website. The **BCN** a is place to a socialize locally both online and off.

The goal of the new site is to aggregate local events based on location as well as provide a place for people to form communities and discuss things.  The current vision is to build a web application followed by mobile apps.

We're building on Open Source technology that is hopefully popular enough to attract additional developers.  [BCN](https://github.com/asommer70/bcn) is a Ruby on Rails application that uses Foundation to look good, OSM and Nominatim to find locations, and PostgreSQL as the backend data store.

So far the the web app can create Posts, add a Location to a Post, and make a Post part of a Community.  There is a lot of work to do with getting things more coherent in the interface as well as writing tests to make sure things work the way they should.

The last couple of weeks I’ve been concentrating on the tests and cleaning up some of my hack.  I whipped up a demo to pitch to the other members of BCN and thankfully they liked my ideas.  Starting a project of this ambition is going to really stretch my skills.

Totally up for the challenge and excited to work on this over the next few months.


# So Far With Rails

I’ve learned a lot more about TDD (Test Driven Development) by working on this Rails project.  Previously I used, well sort of used, TDD on a Python Flask project.  I’ve grown to really love the ability to test things from the command line that I was doing in the browser. 

It is very useful for testing HTML forms.

I started with Ruby way back in 2003/2004 timeframe.  I think it was just after Rails was first released and I saw a little demo of Ajax.  For some reason Rails and Ajax calls were synonymous in my mind for the longest time.  I think it’s because I didn’t understand either technology very well.

After a few failed Rails projects back in the day I’ve come full circle and hopefully this project will triumph and make it to a full 1.0 release.  Also hopefully this will happen in the not too different future.  Don’t want to wait another 10 years.

# Too Much Testing

I’ve come to realize that my inability to do TDD is because of two reasons (or excuses if you like).

1. I didn’t really understand how to test things.  This is probably the main reason.
2. It never really struck me as practical to write a test for very little piece of code.  It always seemed like you’re writing that code twice (or more).

There have been several articles and talks about TDD gone wrong, but after watching DHH’s [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M) from RailsConf 2014 I feel good because there are others who feel the same way.  And they put into much better words then I ever could.

# Conclusion

After a few weeks I'm still very excited about the project... to the detriment of other things I "should" be working on.

Party On!
