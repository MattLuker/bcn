# Purpose

Welcome to the BCN Development Blog.  I’m going to use this blog to document my process of learning Ruby on Rails.  The primary reason to shift the focus is to hopefully provide more value then, a boring recitation of what I’ve been working on in the BCN project.

There seems to me to be a lot of questions on how to learn Rails out there, and hopefully this blog will be a great resource for someone looking to do just that.
