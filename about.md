Welcome to the BCN Development Blog.  We're using this blog to document my process of learning Ruby on Rails.  The primary reason for this focus is to hopefully provide more value then, a boring recitation of what I’ve been working on in the BCN project.

There seems to me to be a lot of questions on how to learn Rails out there, and hopefully this blog will be a great resource for someone looking to do just that.

## Basic Setup

I find that trying something new is always an adventure, well most of the time.  For this attempt to learn Rails my “new thing” is to try a GUI editor and/or IDE.  Over the last seven to eight years, I’ve been exclusively a Vim user.  I’ve used Vim for everything from web development, basic writing, configuration file editing, etc.

A few months ago I finally sat down and learned enough Android development to make a couple of apps, and fell in love with the Android Studio IDE which is a Google customized version of the IntelliJ IDE by JetBrains.  I think the single best feature for me was the code completion.  It really made developing in Java a lot of fun compared to other times I’ve had to write some Java code.

So for this Rails project I thought I’d try out the RubyMine IDE which is the Ruby customized (or themed, skinned, or what have you) version of IntelliJ.  While the Ruby code completion isn’t as good as it is for Java (I wouldn’t expect it to be) it’s been enough to keep my interest in using it.  Probably the best feature for me with RubyMine is the Command+Shift+O hot key that opens the file open dialog.  There are so many different files in a Rails app that keeping track of them becomes difficult.

I know that there are plugins and configuration options that allow Vim to have these exact same features.  What can I say sometimes you just want to try something new.

So that’s my Rails development environment… RubyMine!
